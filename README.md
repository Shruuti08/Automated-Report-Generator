# Automated-Report-Generator

# Project Overview
This project illustrates an automated approach to creating well-structured PDF reports using Python. It involves extracting restaurant data from a Zomato dataset, analyzing the information to generate useful insights, and presenting the findings in a neatly formatted PDF report. The objective is to streamline the reporting process by leveraging Python’s data processing and PDF generation capabilities. Such automation is highly useful in fields like data analytics, business intelligence, academics, and any environment that relies on regular analysis of structured data.

# Objective
- Read and process data from a CSV file.
- Perform relevant analysis such as:
-- Calculating average cost.
-- Identifying top-rated and most-voted restaurants.
-- Analyzing top categories based on listing type.
- Generate a well-structured PDF report summarizing the insights.
- Make the process repeatable and user-friendly.

  # Features
- Automated PDF report generation
- Real-time data analysis
- Smart data cleaning and preprocessing
- Clean and readable PDF formatting
- Fast and lightweight script execution
- Easily reusable with similar datasets

# PDF Report Generation
- Organized into clear sections with headings and spacing.
- Each analysis is output with consistent formatting.
- Exported the report using the FPDF library.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming logic.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- FPDF: For creating and formatting the PDF.
  
# Applications
- Automating business reporting and summaries.
- Academic assignments and data science projects.
- Weekly/monthly performance insights for dashboards.
- Real-time insights for decision-making.
